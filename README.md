# Chip-8 Emulator

A very basic Chip-8 emulator written to learn about comupter architectures and rust. I'd like to implement some pre-existing Chip-8 extensions like the Super Chip-8 and even write my own extensions in the future.

## Running the Emulator

Make sure you have cargo and rust installed. Clone the repo and run:

```
cd desktop
cargo run path/to/game
```

Some example games are included in desktop/c8games.
